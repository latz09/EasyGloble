According to Cibil’s research, 70% of credit applicants gave up in the middle of the application process because of things like lengthy application timeframes, too many fields demanding information, the need to visit a branch, or the need to mail documentation.

According to a TransUnion Cibil research, a credit information firm, up to 22 million customers apply for credit every month, wanting a quick and simple digital application experience so they can access cash more readily. However, 70% of them give up in the middle of the application process owing to the time-consuming processes.

According to a Cibil study report, present procedures are still time-consuming and laborious, requiring credit applicants to go through numerous steps and give a variety of pieces of information as well as identification verification.

It added that this made it extremely difficult for lenders to match customer expectations, together with their strict control over fraud checks and human verifications.

According to the report, 58 percent of personal loan applications took three days or longer to be approved (or more in 77 percent of cases).

Almost 66% of two-wheeler loans required more than three days to be approved, accounting for 91% of all two-wheeler loans that took more than one day to sanction. According to Cibil, 87% of loans in the auto loan market took more than a day to approve, with 64% taking longer than three days.

Satish Pillai, president of TransUnion Asia, stated: “Consumers are wanting an effortless onboarding experience that offers quick, individualised assistance.

Over the last several years, we have witnessed increases in the amount of credit products issued within a day of application, but it is still a shockingly small portion of the total.

This, coupled with the fact that almost 22 million consumers are seeking credit opportunities every month, means the credit industry in India must evolve and undergo a true digital transformation.”

“Lenders need to manage risks effectively while being competitive and meeting the higher expectations and needs of consumers,” he added.

According to Cibil, the results demonstrate that lenders must modernise and expedite the loan application process while controlling risks in order to successfully recruit clients.

“Improving customer journeys frequently appears to be an impossible endeavour. Lenders frequently depend on older or numerous systems and must decide between sustaining them and creating new platforms, according to Pillai.
