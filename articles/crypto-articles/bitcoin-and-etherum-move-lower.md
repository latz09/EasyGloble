# Bitcoin price

<br/>

After a close below the USD 21,000 level, bitcoin price extended its losses and dived briefly below USD 20,000 before recovering. A bearish close below the USD 20,000 support could spark another decline. The first major support on the downside is near the USD 19,500 level. The next major support is near the USD 18,800 zone, below which the price could even test USD 18,000.

<br/>

On the upside, the price might face resistance near the USD 20,500 level. The next major resistance is now near USD 20,850, above which the price could even surpass USD 21,200.

Ethereum price also started another decline below the USD 1,200 support and moved below the USD 1,150 support zone. It is now struggling to stay above the USD 1,100 support zone and is down 9% in a day and almost 1% in a week. The next major support is near USD 1,050, below which the price could revisit the USD 1,000 handle.
